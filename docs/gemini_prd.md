Project Vidoc: An Open-Source, Source-to-Video Synthesis Platform - Architecture and Implementation PlanSection 1: Strategic Overview and Product Definition1.1 Introduction: The Emerging Paradigm of AI-Driven Knowledge SynthesisThe modern information landscape is characterized by an overwhelming volume of data. The traditional model of passive information consumption—reading documents, watching lectures, and manually taking notes—is becoming increasingly inefficient for knowledge workers, researchers, and students. A new paradigm is emerging, one defined by active, AI-assisted knowledge synthesis. In this model, artificial intelligence acts as a partner, transforming vast, unstructured source materials into structured, digestible, and multi-modal formats. This shift is not merely about convenience; it represents a fundamental change in how information is processed, understood, and communicated.1Google's NotebookLM is a prominent example of this evolution. Its features, particularly the ability to generate video overviews from documents, signal a move beyond simple text summarization towards dynamic, engaging content creation.2 By automatically deconstructing complex topics and reassembling them into narrated visual presentations, such tools bridge the gap between raw data and true understanding.1 Project Vidoc is conceived within this context, aiming to provide a powerful platform for this new wave of knowledge synthesis. It is designed not as a simple video generator, but as a comprehensive tool for turning research, notes, and documents into clear, compelling, and shareable narratives.1.2 Competitive Analysis: Learning from NotebookLMA thorough analysis of NotebookLM's "Video Overviews" feature provides a clear baseline for Project Vidoc's functional requirements and strategic positioning. NotebookLM excels at transforming user-uploaded sources into AI-narrated, slide-based videos. The AI intelligently pulls key assets—such as images, diagrams, direct quotes, and numerical data—from the source documents to populate the slides, creating a visually rich and contextually relevant summary.3 This process distills complex information into a more accessible format, making it effective for explaining data, demonstrating processes, and making abstract concepts tangible.2A key strength of the NotebookLM user experience is its seamless, "fire-and-forget" nature. Video generation occurs in the background, allowing users to continue working on other tasks concurrently.4 The platform offers a high degree of customization through "steering prompts," which enable users to direct the AI to focus on specific topics, tailor the content for a particular audience (e.g., beginner vs. expert), or provide additional context.2 Once generated, videos are presented in a simple player with standard controls for playback speed, navigation, and full-screen mode. Sharing options are versatile, supporting direct link sharing, embedding within a shared notebook, or downloading the final video as a standard MP4 file.4Despite these strengths, NotebookLM exhibits limitations that create significant opportunities for an open-source alternative. Its primary constraint is its nature as a proprietary, closed-ecosystem product. It is deeply integrated with Google's infrastructure, particularly its Gemini family of models and Google Workspace, which limits user choice and creates vendor lock-in.3 Users have no visibility into or control over the specific AI models being used or the associated operational costs. While Google provides assurances regarding data privacy, stating that uploaded content is not used for model training 1, a "black box" architecture will always be a point of concern for users and organizations handling sensitive information. Furthermore, at the time of analysis, the feature is available only in English and is not supported on the NotebookLM mobile application, presenting clear, immediate avenues for differentiation.21.3 Project Vidoc: Vision and DifferentiatorsThe vision for Project Vidoc is to democratize AI-powered video creation from research and documents by providing a powerful, flexible, and fully transparent open-source platform. Where proprietary tools offer a polished but rigid experience, Vidoc will offer unparalleled control and extensibility.The primary and most critical differentiator is the "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) architecture. This strategic pillar fundamentally reshapes the relationship between the user, the platform, and the underlying AI services. Instead of the platform bearing the cost and complexity of licensing and operating large-scale AI models, users will provide their own API keys for their preferred Large Language Models (LLMs) like Google Gemini or Cerebras, and Text-to-Speech (TTS) services like Cartesia, ElevenLabs, or Play.ht. This model delivers three transformative benefits:Cost Control: Users directly manage their expenses by leveraging their existing subscriptions, pay-as-you-go plans, or the generous free tiers offered by many AI providers.7 This eliminates the need for the open-source project to implement complex billing systems and makes the platform accessible to a wider audience, from individual students to budget-conscious startups.Model Flexibility: The AI landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace. The BYOK model ensures that Project Vidoc is not tied to any single provider. Users can seamlessly swap out models as new, more powerful, or more cost-effective options become available, effectively future-proofing their workflow.Data Privacy and Transparency: By processing data through the user's own third-party accounts, the BYOK model offers a clearer and more trustworthy data privacy narrative. The user's content is subject to the terms of their agreement with the AI provider they choose, rather than an opaque policy of the platform itself.The secondary differentiator for Project Vidoc is that it will be extensible by design. The system will be built on a modular architecture with well-defined interfaces. This will empower the open-source community to contribute new integrations for additional LLM and TTS providers, develop a library of diverse and creative slide templates, and eventually expand the platform to support new types of source material, such as video transcripts or audio recordings, moving beyond the current document-centric approach of NotebookLM.91.4 Target User Personas and Use CasesProject Vidoc is designed to serve a diverse set of users who need to transform static information into dynamic video content. The core use cases are centered around learning, communication, and content repurposing.The Academic Researcher/Student: This user deals with dense, technical information in the form of academic papers, lecture notes, and textbook chapters. They need to quickly distill this material into a digestible summary for presentation to a study group, as a visual aid for a lecture, or simply as a more engaging way to review complex topics. For them, Vidoc is a powerful study and communication tool that transforms hours of reading into a concise, shareable video overview.1The Content Creator/Marketer: This user's goal is to maximize the reach and impact of their written content. They have a repository of blog posts, whitepapers, case studies, and reports that could find a new audience on video-centric platforms like YouTube, LinkedIn, or Instagram. Vidoc allows them to efficiently repurpose this existing content, creating engaging "video-explainers" or "video-podcasts" without the significant time and expense of manual video production.6The Corporate Trainer/Analyst: Within an organization, this user is responsible for disseminating information effectively. This could involve creating training materials from technical documentation, summarizing competitor analysis reports for executive review, or explaining complex internal processes (SOPs) to new team members. Vidoc serves as a rapid development tool for internal communications, saving significant time and effort compared to creating traditional slide decks or manually recorded presentations.1Section 2: System Architecture and Module Definitions2.1 High-Level Architectural DiagramThe architecture of Project Vidoc is designed as a decoupled, service-oriented system to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability, which are essential for supporting the "Bring Your Own Key" model and future extensibility. The workflow proceeds through a series of independent modules, each with a specific responsibility, communicating through well-defined API contracts.The logical flow is as follows:The Frontend Application (Client) captures user input, including source materials and API keys.It sends a generation request to the Orchestration Service (Backend).The Orchestrator validates the request and sequentially invokes two key modules:The Content Synthesis Module, which uses an LLM to generate a structured video script.The Voice Generation Module, which uses a TTS service to create the narration audio.With the script and audio prepared, the Orchestrator triggers the Video Rendering Engine.The Rendering Engine produces the final MP4 file and notifies the Orchestrator.The Frontend Application is updated with the status and provides the final video to the user.This separation of concerns allows each component to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. For instance, the resource-intensive Video Rendering Engine can be run on more powerful hardware without affecting the performance of the user-facing web application.2.2 Module Definitions2.2.1 Frontend Application (Client)Description: A modern, web-based Single Page Application (SPA) that provides the complete user interface for Project Vidoc. This is the user's sole point of interaction with the platform.Responsibilities:User and Project Management: Handling user accounts (if implemented) and allowing users to create, view, and manage their video generation projects.Source Input: Providing UI components for users to paste raw text, upload documents (e.g., PDF, TXT), or provide URLs to source materials.Secure API Key Management: A critical component of the BYOK model. The frontend must provide a secure and intuitive interface for users to enter and save their API keys for various LLM and TTS services. These keys will be stored locally in the browser (e.g., localStorage) and transmitted securely to the backend for each generation request.Job Initiation and Monitoring: Sending the complete generation request payload to the Orchestration Service and subsequently polling or using a WebSocket connection to monitor the job's status (e.g., PENDING, GENERATING_SCRIPT, RENDERING, COMPLETE, FAILED), providing real-time feedback to the user.Video Playback and Management: Displaying the final rendered video in an embedded player, with options to download, share, or delete the asset.4Technology Recommendation: Next.js. This React-based framework is an ideal choice due to its powerful feature set, including file-based routing, server-side rendering capabilities, and, most importantly, the ability to create API routes.11 These API routes can serve as the initial implementation of the Orchestration Service, simplifying the development and deployment of the project's early versions into a single, cohesive application.2.2.2 Orchestration Service (Backend)Description: The central nervous system of the platform, acting as a stateless API that manages the entire source-to-video workflow. It coordinates the actions of all other backend modules.Responsibilities:API Endpoint: Exposing a secure API endpoint to receive generation requests from the frontend client.Input Validation: Validating the incoming request payload to ensure all necessary data (source material, steering prompt, API keys, model selections) is present and correctly formatted.Secure Key Handling: Receiving user API keys from the client for the duration of a single request. It is responsible for passing these keys to the appropriate downstream modules and must not persist them long-term.Workflow Management: Executing the video generation process in a defined sequence: first calling the Content Synthesis Module to get the script, then the Voice Generation Module to get the audio, and finally triggering the Video Rendering Engine with these assets.Job Status Tracking: Maintaining the state of each generation job in a database or cache, allowing the frontend to query for progress updates.Technology Recommendation: Node.js with Express.js or Fastify. A Node.js backend is a natural fit, allowing for a unified JavaScript/TypeScript language across the full stack. Frameworks like Express.js or Fastify are lightweight, performant, and exceptionally well-suited for building the kind of I/O-bound API service required here, which primarily involves making calls to other services. The service can be deployed as a containerized application or a serverless function for scalability.2.2.3 Content Synthesis ModuleDescription: A dedicated service or, more likely, a library within the Orchestration Service, that functions as an abstraction layer over various LLM providers. Its purpose is to isolate the rest of the system from the specifics of any single LLM API.Responsibilities:Provider Abstraction: Exposing a single, unified function (e.g., generateScript) that takes the source text, a steering prompt, and a provider configuration (e.g., { provider: 'gemini', apiKey: '...' }).Prompt Engineering: Constructing a detailed prompt tailored to the selected LLM. This prompt will include the user's source material, their steering prompt, and, most critically, a formal JSON Schema definition.Enforced Structured Output: Leveraging the native "structured output" or "JSON mode" capabilities of the target LLM API to guarantee that the response is a valid, predictable JSON object that conforms to the predefined schema. This is a well-supported feature across modern LLMs like Gemini, Cerebras, and OpenAI, making it a robust strategy.12API Interaction: Handling the actual API call to the selected provider using the user's API key and returning the parsed JSON object to the Orchestrator.Technology Recommendation: A JavaScript/TypeScript library that utilizes the official SDKs for each supported provider, such as @google/generative-ai for Gemini 15 and @ai-sdk/cerebras for Cerebras models.17 Using official SDKs is preferable to raw HTTP requests as they handle authentication, request formatting, and error handling more gracefully.2.2.4 Voice Generation ModuleDescription: Similar to the Content Synthesis Module, this is an abstraction layer, but for Text-to-Speech (TTS) providers. It decouples the core application logic from the implementation details of specific TTS services.Responsibilities:Provider Abstraction: Exposing a unified function (e.g., synthesizeVoice) that accepts the narration script, voice selection, and provider configuration (e.g., { provider: 'elevenlabs', apiKey: '...', voiceId: '...' }).API Interaction: Calling the appropriate TTS provider's API (e.g., Cartesia 18, ElevenLabs 7, Play.ht 19) with the user's API key.Audio Handling: Receiving the audio response, which may be a direct file download or a stream, and saving it as a standardized audio file (e.g., narration.mp3) in a location accessible to the Video Rendering Engine, such as a temporary directory or a cloud storage bucket.Technology Recommendation: A JavaScript/TypeScript library using provider-specific SDKs or making direct REST API calls with a library like Axios or Fetch. The implementation should handle the different response formats (e.g., audio streams, file buffers) from various providers and normalize them into a single file output.2.2.5 Video Rendering EngineDescription: A specialized, potentially resource-intensive backend service solely dedicated to the computationally heavy task of creating the final MP4 video file from the prepared assets.Responsibilities:Receiving Render Jobs: Accepting a job request from the Orchestrator containing the structured JSON script and the URI of the generated narration audio file.Programmatic Rendering: Using a programmatic video creation framework to render a sequence of scenes or slides based on the data in the JSON script.Asset Synchronization: Perfectly synchronizing the animated visual elements of the slides with the provided narration audio track.Encoding: Encoding the rendered frames and audio into a final, web-compatible MP4 video file.Technology Recommendation: A Node.js service built around the Remotion framework.20 This is a pivotal technology choice. Remotion abstracts away the immense complexity of orchestrating a headless browser (Puppeteer) for frame-by-frame rendering of web technologies (React, HTML, CSS) and invoking FFmpeg with the correct parameters for video encoding and audio muxing.22 Attempting to build this rendering pipeline manually would be extraordinarily difficult and error-prone. Remotion's React-native approach is a perfect match for the project's goal of using HTML/CSS for slide design.Section 3: The Core Pipeline: A Technical Deep DiveThe source-to-video generation process is the technical heart of Project Vidoc. It is a multi-stage pipeline that transforms unstructured user input into a polished, synchronized video file. Each step is designed to be automated and robust, relying on well-defined data contracts between the system's modules.3.1 Step 1: Source Ingestion & Structured Script GenerationThe pipeline begins when the user submits their source materials through the frontend application. This can be raw text, an uploaded document, or a URL, accompanied by a "steering prompt" that guides the AI's focus (e.g., "Explain this for a beginner," "Focus on the financial implications").2The request, containing the sources, prompt, chosen LLM provider, and the user's corresponding API key, is sent to the Orchestration Service. The Orchestrator then invokes the Content Synthesis Module, which executes the most critical step in the content creation phase. The module constructs a detailed prompt for the selected LLM. This prompt does not simply ask for a summary; it explicitly instructs the model to generate a response that conforms to a predefined JSON Schema. This use of structured output constraints is a powerful and reliable feature supported by modern LLM APIs, including Google Gemini, Cerebras, and OpenAI.12 By enforcing a schema, the system ensures the LLM's output is not just text, but a predictable, machine-readable data structure that can be directly consumed by the downstream rendering engine.An example of the JSON Schema that would be provided to the LLM is as follows:JSON{
  "title": "A concise, engaging title for the video.",
  "slides": [
    {
      "slide_type": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": ["title", "content", "quote", "image", "list"],
        "description": "The type of slide layout to use."
      },
      "narration": "The exact text to be spoken by the TTS voice for this slide.",
      "content": {
        "title_text": "Optional title text to display on the slide.",
        "body_text": "The main body text for a content slide.",
        "list_items": ["An array of strings for a bulleted list slide."],
        "quote_text": "The text for a quote slide.",
        "source_citation": "The source of the quote or data.",
        "image_query": "A descriptive query for finding a relevant background image (e.g., 'futuristic cityscape at night')."
      }
    }
  ]
}
The Content Synthesis Module receives the structured JSON response from the LLM, validates it against the schema one last time, and passes this "video script" object back to the Orchestrator, completing the first stage of the pipeline.3.2 Step 2: Voice SynthesisWith the structured JSON script in hand, the Orchestration Service prepares for audio generation. It extracts the narration text from each object within the slides array. These text snippets are concatenated into a single, complete script for the entire video.The Orchestrator then calls the Voice Generation Module, passing this full script along with the user's chosen TTS provider (e.g., Cartesia, ElevenLabs), their API key, and any selected voice preferences (e.g., voice ID, style). The Voice Generation Module then makes an API call to the specified TTS service.7 For this use case, a non-streaming, high-quality synthesis endpoint is ideal, as the entire script is known in advance. The module receives the synthesized audio, typically as an MP3 or WAV stream or file buffer, and saves it to a temporary, accessible location (such as a cloud storage bucket like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage) under a unique identifier (e.g., job-12345-narration.mp3). The URL to this audio file is then returned to the Orchestrator.3.3 Step 3: Programmatic Video Rendering with RemotionThis stage combines the visual and auditory components into a final video. The Orchestrator initiates a new job in the dedicated Video Rendering Engine. This is not a manual process but a programmatic API call to the rendering service.The core of this step leverages the Remotion framework's server-side rendering capabilities.24 The Orchestrator calls Remotion's renderMedia() function, which is a high-level API that simplifies the entire rendering process.24 The key to connecting the data to the visuals lies in the inputProps option of this function. The entire structured JSON script generated by the LLM, along with the URL to the narration.mp3 file, is passed into the Remotion project as this inputProps object.28Inside the Remotion project, which is fundamentally a React application, the magic happens:A main React component, let's call it VideoComposition, uses the useInputProps() hook to access the JSON script and audio URL.The component includes a single <Audio /> component at its top level, with its src prop set to the narration audio URL.29 Remotion's engine ensures this audio is loaded and perfectly synchronized with the video frames.The component then uses Remotion's <Series> component to define a sequence of scenes.30 It maps over the slides array from the input JSON.For each slide object in the array, a <Series.Sequence> is created. Inside the sequence, a switch statement on the slide.slide_type property determines which specific slide component to render (e.g., <TitleSlide>, <ContentSlide>, <QuoteSlide>).Each of these slide components is a standard React component styled with HTML and CSS. They receive their content (e.g., title_text, body_text) as props from the JSON data. Animations for text and elements can be implemented using powerful libraries like anime.js 31 or even pure CSS animations and transitions 32, bringing the slides to life.This data-driven approach means the video's structure, content, and length are determined entirely by the JSON generated by the LLM, making the rendering process incredibly dynamic and flexible.3.4 Step 4: Finalization and DeliveryThe renderMedia() function from Remotion handles the final, complex steps of video production automatically.24 In the background, it performs a series of orchestrated actions:Headless Browser Rendering: It launches a headless instance of Google Chrome using Puppeteer.22Frame Capture: It "plays" the React animation within the headless browser and takes a high-resolution screenshot (as a PNG or JPEG) for every single frame of the video. This is how the HTML and CSS designs are converted into a sequence of images.Video Encoding: It invokes the powerful FFmpeg command-line tool, feeding it the sequence of captured image frames and instructing it to encode them into a standard video codec like H.264.Audio Muxing: It instructs FFmpeg to take the newly created video stream and "mux" (combine) it with the narration.mp3 audio file that was generated earlier.33Output: The final, combined output.mp4 file is saved to a specified destination.Once the rendering process is complete, the Video Rendering Engine notifies the Orchestration Service. The Orchestrator updates the job's status to COMPLETE, stores the URL of the final MP4, and makes this information available to the frontend. The user is then notified that their video is ready and can be played, downloaded, or shared directly from the UI.4Section 4: Recommended Technology Stack & RationaleThe selection of a technology stack is a critical architectural decision that directly impacts development velocity, scalability, maintainability, and operational cost. The following stack is recommended for Project Vidoc, with each choice justified based on the project's unique requirements for flexibility, performance, and open-source alignment. The central pillar of this stack is the Remotion framework, which elegantly solves the most complex challenge of the project: programmatic, server-side video generation from web technologies.ComponentRecommended TechnologyRationaleSupporting SnippetsFrontend FrameworkNext.js (React)Provides a robust, production-grade React framework. Its API routes can host the Orchestration Service initially, simplifying deployment for a monolithic start. Its architecture aligns perfectly with Remotion's React-based nature, enabling code and type sharing between the frontend and the video rendering project.11Backend/OrchestrationNode.js with Express.js/FastifyA lightweight, high-performance runtime ideal for managing the I/O-bound tasks that dominate the orchestration workflow (i.e., making API calls to other services). Using JavaScript/TypeScript across the entire stack simplifies development and reduces cognitive overhead for the team.N/A (Standard Industry Practice)Video Rendering EngineRemotionCrucial Choice. Remotion is the cornerstone of the technical strategy. It abstracts the immense complexity of headless browser automation (Puppeteer) and FFmpeg command-line operations. Its React-native approach is a perfect fit for creating dynamic, data-driven slides using familiar HTML/CSS and animation libraries. It natively handles audio synchronization, a major engineering hurdle in manual solutions.20Underlying RendererPuppeteer (managed by Remotion)Remotion leverages Puppeteer to render React components in a headless Chrome instance frame-by-frame. This is the core mechanism that converts dynamic HTML and CSS into a sequence of static images ready for video encoding.22Video/Audio AssemblyFFmpeg (managed by Remotion)The undisputed industry standard for all media manipulation. Remotion uses FFmpeg under the hood to "stitch" the captured image frames into a video stream and mux (combine) it with the generated audio track to produce the final MP4 file.23LLM IntegrationProvider SDKs (e.g., @google/generative-ai, @ai-sdk/cerebras)Using official Software Development Kits (SDKs) is the most reliable and maintainable method for interacting with third-party APIs. They provide well-tested methods for authentication, request formatting, and leveraging advanced features like structured JSON output, reducing boilerplate code and potential errors.15TTS IntegrationProvider SDKs/REST APIs (e.g., Cartesia, ElevenLabs, Play.ht)Direct integration via official SDKs or well-documented REST APIs ensures full compatibility and access to all provider features, such as voice selection, language options, and audio quality settings. This is essential for delivering a high-quality user experience.19DeploymentDocker / Serverless (e.g., AWS Lambda, Vercel Functions)Containerizing the Orchestrator and Rendering Engine with Docker provides portability, consistency across environments, and straightforward scalability. Furthermore, Remotion has first-class support for serverless rendering via packages like @remotion/lambda, which can be highly cost-effective as it only incurs costs during active rendering jobs.27Section 5: Implementation Blueprints and Code ExamplesThis section provides concrete code examples for the most critical and complex components of the Project Vidoc system. These blueprints are intended to serve as a proof-of-concept and a practical guide for the engineering team, demonstrating how the architectural concepts translate into working code.5.1 Defining and Using a JSON Schema with the Gemini APIThis Node.js snippet demonstrates how to use the @google/generative-ai library to request a structured JSON output from the Gemini API. The responseSchema is defined using Pydantic-style classes, which the library translates into the required JSON Schema format for the API call.15JavaScript// In the Content Synthesis Module
import { GoogleGenerativeAI, HarmCategory, HarmBlockThreshold } from "@google/generative-ai";

// Define the schema for a single slide
const SlideSchema = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    slide_type: { type: 'string', enum: ['title', 'content', 'quote'] },
    narration: { type: 'string', description: 'The narration for this slide.' },
    content: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        title_text: { type: 'string', nullable: true },
        body_text: { type: 'string', nullable: true },
        quote_text: { type: 'string', nullable: true },
        source_citation: { type: 'string', nullable: true },
      },
    },
  },
  required: ['slide_type', 'narration', 'content'],
};

// Define the top-level schema for the entire video script
const VideoScriptSchema = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    title: { type: 'string', description: 'A concise title for the video.' },
    slides: { type: 'array', items: SlideSchema },
  },
  required: ['title', 'slides'],
};

async function generateStructuredScript(apiKey, sourceText, steeringPrompt) {
  const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(apiKey);
  const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({
    model: "gemini-1.5-flash",
    generationConfig: {
      responseMimeType: "application/json",
      responseSchema: VideoScriptSchema,
    },
  });

  const prompt = `
    Source Material: "${sourceText}"
    ---
    Instructions: "${steeringPrompt}"
    ---
    Based on the source material and instructions, generate a video script.
  `;

  const result = await model.generateContent(prompt);
  const response = result.response;
  // The response.text() is a JSON string that conforms to VideoScriptSchema
  return JSON.parse(response.text());
}
5.2 A Dynamic Remotion Slide ComponentThis example shows a React component for a "content slide" within the Remotion project. It accepts props that directly correspond to the fields in the JSON schema and uses Remotion's animation functions (interpolate, useCurrentFrame) to create simple entrance animations.TypeScript// In src/components/ContentSlide.tsx (Remotion Project)
import React from 'react';
import { useCurrentFrame, interpolate } from 'remotion';
import './ContentSlide.css'; // For styling

interface ContentSlideProps {
  title: string;
  body: string;
}

export const ContentSlide: React.FC<ContentSlideProps> = ({ title, body }) => {
  const frame = useCurrentFrame();

  // Animate opacity from 0 to 1 in the first 20 frames
  const opacity = interpolate(frame, , , {
    extrapolateRight: 'clamp',
  });

  // Animate title sliding in from the top
  const titleY = interpolate(frame, , [-50, 0], {
    extrapolateLeft: 'clamp',
    extrapolateRight: 'clamp',
  });

  return (
    <div className="slide-container content-slide" style={{ opacity }}>
      <h1 style={{ transform: `translateY(${titleY}px)` }}>{title}</h1>
      <p>{body}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
5.3 The Main Remotion Composition (Video.tsx)This is the root component of the Remotion video. It uses useInputProps to get the data from the server-side render call. It then uses <Series> and <Audio> to construct the full video timeline dynamically from the JSON script.29TypeScript// In src/Video.tsx (Remotion Project)
import { Composition, Series, useInputProps } from 'remotion';
import { Audio } from 'remotion';
import { TitleSlide } from './components/TitleSlide';
import { ContentSlide } from './components/ContentSlide';
//... import other slide types

// Define the shape of the input props using TypeScript
interface VideoInputProps {
  title: string;
  slides: Array<{
    slide_type: string;
    narration: string; // Narration is handled by the global audio
    content: {
      title_text?: string;
      body_text?: string;
      //... other content fields
    };
  }>;
  audioUrl: string;
}

export const RemotionVideo: React.FC = () => {
  // Get the JSON script and audio URL passed from the server
  const props = useInputProps<VideoInputProps>();

  if (!props) {
    return null; // Render nothing if props are not available
  }

  return (
    <>
      {/* Global audio track for the entire video */}
      <Audio src={props.audioUrl} />

      <Series>
        {/* First slide is always the main title */}
        <Series.Sequence durationInFrames={150}>
          <TitleSlide title={props.title} />
        </Series.Sequence>

        {/* Map over the slides data to create a sequence for each */}
        {props.slides.map((slide, index) => (
          <Series.Sequence key={index} durationInFrames={240}>
            {/* A real implementation would have a more robust way to calculate duration */}
            {slide.slide_type === 'content' && (
              <ContentSlide
                title={slide.content.title_text |

| ''}
                body={slide.content.body_text |

| ''}
              />
            )}
            {/* Add cases for 'quote', 'image', etc. */}
          </Series.Sequence>
        ))}
      </Series>
    </>
  );
};
5.4 Triggering a Server-Side RenderThis Node.js script, part of the Orchestration Service, demonstrates how to programmatically invoke Remotion's rendering engine using the @remotion/renderer package. It shows how to find the composition and pass the dynamic inputProps to it.24JavaScript// In the Orchestration Service
import { renderMedia, selectComposition } from '@remotion/renderer';
import path from 'path';

const compositionId = 'MyVideo'; // The ID of the Composition in Remotion
const entry = path.resolve('./remotion-project/src/index.ts'); // Path to Remotion project entry

async function startRender(videoScript, audioUrl) {
  // Find the composition metadata
  const composition = await selectComposition({
    serveUrl: entry,
    id: compositionId,
    inputProps: { videoScript, audioUrl }, // Pass our data here
  });

  console.log('Starting video render...');

  // Start the render process
  await renderMedia({
    composition,
    serveUrl: entry,
    codec: 'h264',
    outputLocation: `public/videos/${Date.now()}.mp4`,
    inputProps: {...videoScript, audioUrl }, // Pass the data again
  });

  console.log('Render finished!');
  return outputLocation;
}
5.5 Calling a TTS API (e.g., Cartesia)This snippet shows a basic implementation for calling the Cartesia TTS API. It includes setting the required custom header Cartesia-Version and handling the streaming audio response, saving it to a file.39JavaScript// In the Voice Generation Module
import fs from 'fs';
import { Writable } from 'stream';
import axios from 'axios';

async function generateCartesiaAudio(apiKey, text, voiceId) {

Section 6: User Interface (UI) Design SpecificationsThese specifications provide detailed, text-based descriptions of the key pages in the Project Vidoc user interface. They are designed to be comprehensive enough for direct input into an AI-powered UI design tool or to serve as a clear brief for a UX/UI designer to create wireframes and mockups.6.1 Page: Dashboard / My ProjectsThis page serves as the user's home base, providing an at-a-glance overview of all their video generation projects.Layout: A clean, modern dashboard layout. The main content area will feature a grid of project cards. A persistent sidebar on the left provides navigation to other sections like "Settings" or "Help."Elements:Header: A prominent header displays the "Project Vidoc" logo and a large, primary call-to-action button labeled "+ Create New Video".Search Bar: Located just below the header, a search input allows users to filter their projects by title in real-time.Project Grid: The central area is populated with project cards. Each card will display:A video thumbnail, which is automatically generated (e.g., the first frame of the video).The video title.Key metadata such as creation date and video duration (e.g., "Created July 26, 2025 - 2:45 min").On hover, a set of action icons appears: "Play" (opens the player view), "Share" (opens a sharing modal), "Download" (initiates an MP4 download), and "Delete" (with a confirmation prompt).Empty State: If the user has no projects, the grid area will display a helpful message like "You haven't created any videos yet. Click 'Create New Video' to get started!"6.2 Page: New Project & ConfigurationThis is the core creation workspace where users define their video generation job. The design should guide the user through the configuration process logically.Layout: A single-page, multi-section form. The layout should be clean and uncluttered to avoid overwhelming the user.Section 1: Provide Your Sources:A large, resizable text area for users to paste raw text content.A clearly marked file upload area with a button or drag-and-drop functionality, specifying supported formats like .txt, .pdf, and .md.An input field for pasting a URL, which the backend will scrape for content.Section 2: Define Your Video:Steering Prompt: A text input field labeled "Steering Prompt (Optional)". Placeholder text should provide examples like "Create a 5-slide summary for a university-level audience" or "Focus on the key statistics and their implications" to educate the user on its purpose.2Content Model: A dropdown menu labeled "Content Generation Model" allowing the user to select from the available LLM integrations (e.g., "Google Gemini 1.5 Flash", "Cerebras Llama 3.1 8B").Voice Configuration:A dropdown labeled "Voice Provider" (e.g., "ElevenLabs", "Cartesia", "Play.ht").A second dropdown labeled "Voice," which will be dynamically populated with a list of available voices after the user provides a valid API key for the selected provider.Section 3: API Key Management (BYOK):This section is critical and must be designed for clarity and trust. It should be visually distinct, perhaps within a bordered box with a lock icon.A clear heading: "Connect Your AI Services".A series of input fields, one for each potential service (e.g., "Google Gemini API Key", "ElevenLabs API Key", "Cerebras API Key"). These fields must be of type password to obscure the keys as they are typed.A "Save & Verify Keys" button. An accompanying note should explain: "Your keys are saved securely in your browser and are only sent to our server when you generate a video."Each input field should have a small status indicator (e.g., a green checkmark) that appears after a key has been successfully verified (via a quick test API call).Action Button: A large, primary "Generate Video" button at the bottom of the page. This button should be disabled until the required fields (at least one source and the necessary API keys for the selected models) are filled. While generating, this button should change to a disabled state showing a spinner and text like "Generating... this may take a few minutes."6.3 Page: Video Studio / Player ViewThis page is presented after a video has been successfully generated. It focuses on the consumption and distribution of the final asset.Layout: A focused, media-centric layout where the video player is the hero element.Elements:Video Player: A large, responsive video player is centered on the page. It will have all standard controls: play/pause, a timeline scrubber for navigation, a volume control with mute toggle, and a fullscreen button.4Title: The title of the video, as generated by the LLM, is displayed prominently above the player.Action Bar: A row of buttons is situated directly below the player for easy access:Download MP4: A primary button that initiates a direct download of the video file.4Share: A secondary button that, when clicked, opens a modal window. The modal contains a unique, shareable link to the video and buttons to copy the link to the clipboard.Feedback: Simple "Good Video" / "Bad Video" thumb icons to gather user feedback on the quality of the generation.4Optional Sidebar: To enhance the experience, a collapsible sidebar could be included. This sidebar could display the full text of the generated narration script, with the currently spoken sentence highlighted in sync with the video playback. It could also list the key citations or sources extracted from the original documents.Section 7: Phased Implementation and Task BreakdownA phased implementation approach is recommended to de-risk the project, deliver value incrementally, and build a solid foundation before adding complexity. The project is broken down into three logical phases: establishing the core technical pipeline, building the user-facing application, and finally, polishing the product for a public release.Phase 1: Core Backend and Rendering Pipeline (The "Spike")The primary goal of this phase is to prove the viability of the end-to-end technical concept. This "spike" will focus exclusively on the backend systems, going from a hardcoded input to a downloadable MP4 file, validating the most complex and uncertain parts of the architecture first.Task IDTask DescriptionDependenciesEst. Effort (Dev-Days)T1.1Setup project monorepo, a basic Node.js server (Orchestrator), and a new Remotion project (Rendering Engine).-2T1.2Implement a hardcoded renderMedia API call in the Orchestrator to render a static, non-dynamic Remotion video to prove the rendering setup works.T1.11T1.3Implement the Content Synthesis Module for a single LLM provider (e.g., Gemini) with a strictly defined JSON schema to generate a script from a hardcoded text input.T1.12T1.4Implement the Voice Generation Module for a single TTS provider (e.g., ElevenLabs) to generate an audio file from the text in the LLM-generated script.T1.31T1.5Connect the full pipeline: Modify the Orchestrator to pass the LLM-generated JSON and the TTS audio URL as inputProps to the renderMedia call.T1.2, T1.3, T1.43T1.6Develop a set of dynamic Remotion slide components (e.g., Title, Content, Quote) that render their content based on the received JSON schema via inputProps.T1.53Phase 2: Frontend UI and User InteractionWith the core backend pipeline validated, this phase focuses on building the user-facing application. The goal is to create a fully functional interface that allows users to configure and initiate video generation jobs and view the results.Task IDTask DescriptionDependenciesEst. Effort (Dev-Days)T2.1Setup the Next.js frontend application with basic routing, layout, and styling framework.-2T2.2Build the "New Project & Configuration" page UI, including all forms and input fields as specified.T2.13T2.3Implement secure client-side API key management (saving to localStorage and passing with requests).T2.22T2.4Connect the UI form to the backend Orchestration API, allowing a user to trigger a real generation job.T1.5, T2.22T2.5Implement job status monitoring on the frontend, either via polling the Orchestrator or using a WebSocket connection for real-time progress updates.T2.42T2.6Build the "Video Studio" player page to display the final video once the job status is "COMPLETE".T2.52T2.7Build the "Dashboard" page to list all videos created by the user, fetching data from the backend.T2.62Phase 3: Polish, Extensibility, and DeploymentThis final phase transitions the project from a functional prototype to a polished, robust, and extensible platform ready for an initial public release. The focus is on adding provider variety, improving resilience, and preparing for deployment.Task IDTask DescriptionDependenciesEst. Effort (Dev-Days)T3.1Extend the Content Synthesis Module to support a second LLM provider (e.g., Cerebras), demonstrating the modularity of the design.T1.32T3.2Extend the Voice Generation Module to support a second TTS provider (e.g., Cartesia), further validating the abstraction layer.T1.42T3.3Implement robust error handling and user feedback across the entire pipeline (e.g., invalid API keys, LLM content refusals, video rendering failures).T2.43T3.4Create a library of at least 5-7 diverse, professionally designed, and animated HTML/CSS slide templates that users can choose from.T1.64T3.5Containerize the application services (Orchestrator, Rendering Engine) using Docker for portable and scalable deployment.T2.72T3.6Write comprehensive documentation for both end-users (how to use the platform) and developers (how to set up the project locally and contribute).-5ConclusionProject Vidoc represents a strategic and technically sound approach to creating an open-source platform for AI-driven knowledge synthesis. By learning from the successes and limitations of proprietary systems like Google's NotebookLM, it charts a course toward a more flexible, transparent, and user-centric solution.The architectural foundation of the project is built upon three key pillars that ensure its viability and long-term potential. First, the "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) model is a fundamental strategic decision that elegantly solves the prohibitive operational costs of AI APIs for an open-source project while empowering users with ultimate control over their data and expenses. Second, the decoupled, service-oriented architecture ensures the platform is modular and extensible, capable of adapting to the rapidly changing AI landscape by allowing for the seamless addition of new models and services. Third, the selection of Remotion as the core rendering engine is a critical technical choice that abstracts away immense complexity, enabling the creation of dynamic, high-quality videos from standard web technologies like React, HTML, and CSS.The implementation plan, broken into logical phases, provides a clear and de-risked path from concept to execution. By first validating the core rendering pipeline, then building the user interface, and finally polishing the platform for release, the project can progress with confidence. The successful execution of this plan will result in a powerful tool that not only serves as a viable alternative to existing solutions but also fosters a community of developers and creators dedicated to pushing the boundaries of AI-assisted content creation. Project Vidoc is positioned not just to be a product, but a foundational platform for the future of automated knowledge communication.
